   documented one afternoon was already wrong the next morning — "Show panes"
   became "Show N panes" when the count moved into the button — and nothing
   failed. A human noticed, which is the slowest detector available.

   tests/ant-guide.test.ts pins ANT-GUIDE.md the same way; this file is its
   sibling for the two reference docs, kept separate so the two can be edited
   without collision.

   The rule that makes these worth running: derive the expectation from the CODE
   wherever possible, so a new module or a renamed symbol fails here rather than
   quietly outdating a paragraph. A hardcoded list only catches a doc that lies
   today; a code-derived one catches the doc the moment the product moves. */
